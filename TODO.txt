DONE:
fix problems with nodes not updating sizes till you manualy change it [V]
fix the problem with Show node incorrectly calculating its size based on size of input generators [V]
fix the problem with show node painting outside of bounds if input generator misbehaves [V]
implement SequentialGenerator (runs supplied generators in a set order)

ALMOST:
fix the problem with generators not always returning correct sizes
refactor all Generators to use parameter maps instead of fields
fix leaves generation in TreeGenerator

TODO:
implement InterpolateConfig node that takes 2 configs and seed and returns different interpolation of them each time
add easier name/min/max configuration from ui for CreateConfig nodes (maybe see color picker for ideas?)
implement clearings and other obstacles (as a Region node passed to params that generators can add to (remove from?) and query)
fix the bug with ColorGradient being saved and loaded as Object instead of its proper type
implement CanvasAtlas(run supplied generator specified number of times with next random numbers and keep N results in canvases) and return generator that draws one of them each time
implement curve drawing on InterpolateConfig node for changing the mapping function rng->result
implement generators creating several layers of images (for tree shadows for example)
add sun direction as parameter for generators
